<p>A sociocultural exploration of the cueing systems, word meaning, fluency, comprehension of text function, structure and genre, and writing play a critical role in developing and assessing academic literacies. Building upon theoretical foundations of the prerequisite literacy course, this course examines strategies that expand academic literacies that recognize the role of identity and power.</p>

<p>This class is organized around five units. Every unit is composed of related topics. Each topic is broken into a read, write, and participate task. Everything will be hosted in Blackboard. You may choose to use Blackboard or your own website. An RSS feed will be provided but all students must upload links or submit assignments to each Module in Blackboard.</p>
<p>Read Task</p>
<p>We will utilize <a href="https://hypothes.is&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1590423280631000">https://hypothes.is</a>&nbsp;to annotate and take notes on one reading per topic. You are welcome to utilize the social annotations tool on the other readings as well.</p>
<p>You need to track and share how you take notes as you read. This may be a blog reflection or a screenshot of your notes. The goal is to model the types note taking strategies you will need to teach students in grades 3-6</p>
<p>Each topic will have an assigned discussion director, a word hunter, and a digging deeper detective. You will have all three roles at different times during the class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discussion Director: You will post questions about the readings to your group. All questions get approved by Dr. Mac before they are posted. You then facilitate the discussion of that topic during the week.</li>
<li>Word Hunter-You have to identify all key words or concepts from the readings or topics and add to the class wiki.</li>
<li>Digging Deeper Detective</li>
</ul>
<p>Write Task</p>
<p>You then take the information you learned from the readings and synthesize this into your own original writing. These are concise statements or deep questions. The key factor in success is utilizing the evidence from the readings and your peers and combining this with your experience or what you know.</p>
<p>Strategies:</p>
<p>Pre-plan: Paper is your friend. Research even shows it improves learning. Draft: Write and revise</p>
<p>Features of a successful blog post</p>
<ul>
<li>A well organized argument or main point, supported through the use of hyperlinks and multimedia materials (video, sound, images)</li>
<li>A clear, unified voice that is appropriate for the intended reading public</li>
<li>A title that links clearly to the content of the post</li>
</ul>
<p>Features of a successful blog</p>
<ul>
<li>Short, concise posts that use multimedia materials (video, images) to effectively make a point</li>
<li>Effective use of hyperlinks to support ideas, to direct readers to relevant, interesting posts, and to demonstrate an awareness of the community of writers focusing on a common theme or set of ideas</li>
<li>A clear, unified voice that continues to grow and develop over time</li>
</ul>
<p>Qualities of a skilled blogger</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to quickly synthesize and articulate ideas</li>
<li>An awareness of a wide range of blogging techniques and of how these various techniques reach different target audiences effectively or ineffectively</li>

<tr>
<td>
<p>This is an intensive five week class. Success is determined by your commitment to learning rather than relying on rubrics and numbers. You need to demonstrate the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to be a successful classroom teacher</p>
<p>Individual Tasks</p>
<p>You are required to post all read and write post by the stated dates in the syllabi. This provides evidence of your ability to set and accomplish goals. These assignments are scored dichotomously. You did or did not.</p>
<p>However patterns of evidence will emerge across these posts that should show growth over time.</p>
<p>Performance Task:</p>
<p>All performance tasks are judged against the stated criterion. You should ensure your artifacts demonstrate mastery of the goals. After each module you are to post a reflection explaining what you did, how you did it, and how this met the criteria.</p>
<p>If I feel you did provide evidence of this growth I will award you a credential. Successful performance i class requires you to collect all the badges.</p>
<p>Group Task:</p>
<p>Your dispositions as a teacher will be assessed during your group task. How well do you communicate, plan, and write with others is a key skill for teachers,</p>
<p>A survey will be sent to try and match members with availability and preferred methods of communication.</p>
<p>Alternative assignments will not be provided for those who do not complete scheduled group tasks. If a group member is not performing their duties email Dr. Mac.</p>

<p>Absence: Time in class contributes directly and significantly to the development of knowledge, competencies, and professional dispositions of candidates in the SCSU Graduate Reading Program. For this reason, all candidates should strive for perfect attendance in each class. However, in the event that absence is unavoidable, missed class time will be made-up with additional course work that reflects the content and purpose of the class. All other assignments listed on the course syllabus for that are still due. Make-up assignments for missed class time will be graded and might include a paper of substantial length or other projects (e.g. an extra tutoring session with a child if the class is a practicum; a presentation; a campus meeting and/or class; etc.). What form the make-up assignment takes is at the discretion of the professor. If this work is not completed to the professor&rsquo;s expectations and/or there is an additional absence (total of two absences), the final grade may be lowered (i.e., A- to B+; B to B-). Students with two absences must confer with Dr. Randall before make up work will be accepted by the course instructor.</p>
