       <p>Week note Reflection of  <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://jgregorymcverry.com/todolist#2019-11-22">My To Do list</a>       

  <p class="p-name e-content">Thrusday's to do list ended up taking me through most of the wrrkend</p>
  <p>I got the OER curriculum map work done. You can check it out on our <a href="http://wiki.goifnetwork.org/OER_Ghana:_Mozilla_Leaders_X_Training_Curriculum">wiki</a>.</p>
  <p>I also did one round of video feedback for #edu407 lessons and posted all the videos for #edu307 and #edu407.</p>
  <p>I took on some client work this week. I haven't had as many contracts this year so this is a much needed suprise. One was planned. I am developing a series of modules o best practices for online teaching.</p>
  <p>The other project was a rush job for a client. I was given a ton of survey data, with only three quantifiable question and asked to do a data analysis and make recommendations. I think it went well but it ate up my weekend. 
  <p>I did get to sneak in a game of Risk, well three turrns with the kids on Sunday, and John's lego robotics team made it to states.</p>
