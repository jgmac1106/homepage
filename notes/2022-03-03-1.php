&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you zoom in
to the state of the union?

It really hurt me
to hear no h/t
to cybersecurity
Bridges and free day care
no mention of data
in the air

now to be
fair
this must be taught in
diapers
before scary wipers
(both kinds)

Occam's Razor to Me
protect our digital
boundaries
even
as
E. Orders thrust us
towards zero trust
hoarders stack attacks
of ransomware

So Let us be okay
(yeah I mean help pay) and
share the burden
Head the Call!
Shields Up.
Yes ma'am can you
spare us two pence
for the cup?

Tax Breaks and
Hand Shakes
Third Party Attestation
Shakes hands
and breaks attacks on
complex systems
While Biden maybe
hiding public discussions
from the Russians
Senate past a bill
that will have
massive
repercussions
the Portman/Peters/Putin Act
well that ain't the name to be exact
will try to light a fire by
requiring mandatory
reporting in
72 hours for those
with power
of critical
infrastructure
No more duck and
cover
(or insurance)
Also tries
to modernize
FedRAMP
I'd need a Genie Lamp
to afford that stamp
Then it turns to FISMA
Just to Hicthya
Three Times
Reauthorizes while
making the stacks
Hinge on Risk Based
Benjamins
