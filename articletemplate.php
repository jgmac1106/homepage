     <p>Every day the #clmooc crew releases a new word for our <a href="https://clmooc.com/come-sail-into-the-poetry-port/">Poetry Port</a>. On 2020-02-11 the word was create. I really didn't know where to begin. Creation is such a violent process for me. I kick scream and curse. I throw stuff, it's bad, but that's art. I was stuck</p>
     <p>Then on the drive to work I was listening to "Redemption Ark" by Alistair Reynolds. In chapter 15 right arond the seveenteen mark a character explains how intertia works when describing a new intertia supressing drive</p>
     <p>The way Reynolds described a force of matter we all take for granted sounded poetic. Especially this line of "Matter is lazy."</p>
     <p>It also to me felt like the opposite of art. Movement versus none. I immediatley bookmarked the clip and drive to the office. </p>
     <p>Once on campus I played the clip a few more times. I then started to draft the poem on paper as you can see in the screenshot. I continued my work with trying to capture the mood of a poem with more internal read rhmyes and assonance. For so many years I have fooled with free verse. The work of rhyme, without being forced intor traps ain't a lazy matter at all.</p>
     <p>Here is the poem <a href="https://quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com/2020/02/11/inertia-of-art-create-poem-for-the-clmooc-poetryport">Inertia of Art</a>
