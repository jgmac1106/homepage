      <p> Do you ache for a better web? Tired of social media being weaponized while notifications pick at your brain slowly draining attention away from what matters? We can find a calmer more humane approach that centers on people rather than corporations. We can help to build a better web by blogging from our own websites and embracing philosophies of the #IndieWeb.</p>
      <p>On Feb 8-9th bloggers, hackers, developers, educators, and others will gather for a <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/2020/02/indiewebcamp-online-gUpSVUxbUKhv">Two Day Online IndieWebCamp</a>. Learn how you, your students, and your community can own your data, control the spaces you publish, and make better connections with #IndieWeb building blocks.</p>
      <h2>What is an IndieWeb Camp?</h2>
      <p>IndieWebCamps are two day gathering for independent web creators of all kinds, from teachers, to graphic artists,  designers, UX engineers, coders, hackers, to share ideas, actively work on creating for their own personal websites, and build upon each others creations. Our online camps work the same. On day one we begin with brief keynotes. Then a voluntary introduction round where you show your website and maybe something you recently added.</p>
      <p>We then move into unconference sessions. Similar to EdCamps or other unconferences session attendees propose and run session. Have something you want to teach? Great propose a session. Project you are working on? Makes a great idea for a session. Want to learn something? Ask by choosing a slot. More details on how to prpose sessions will follow. This year we will have three video chat rooms open across three session slots.</p>
      <p>Then on the second day we focus on hacking away on a goal for our site, writing content, creating new tools, or planning community events. We finish by demoing what we have built. During hack day we will keep a drop in video room open. We also encourage folks to pick a buddy and do checkins on time intervals to find out what has been working. You explain what you did that hour and what your goal is for the next hour. Due to the multiple timezones we will schedule two different demo day times. </p>
      <h2>Who Should Attend IndieWebCamp Online?</h2>
      <p>Everyone. Whether you have never created a website or you spun up your own CMS these camps are open to all ages and all skill levels. You can come to the event and two days l;ater leave with your first website or a new feature for your publishing platform.</p>
      <p>We also encourage sessions from around the wold and hope to offer a multilingual program. This year we hope facilitator's offer sessions possibly in Russian, Spanish, and Portuguese. We need to make the plurarlity of the web a global movement. To that end this year we are pleased to announce our keynote speaker <a href="http://sadik.goifnetwork.org/">Sadik Shahdua</a> who will share their tale about creating an Open Educational Resource network in Ghana using IndieWeb building blocks.</p>
