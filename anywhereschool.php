<td>Acceptance that instructional value is not just on subjects that get standardized testing</td>
<td>Stage 3 - Discomfort</td>
<td>A small group of the population and parents reporting data on this could effect school offerings and it feels uncomfortable to have to make those decisions when you don&rsquo;t necessarily have anything to do with them.</td>
<td>Administration needs to set up More decisive goals for what they consider a successful job to look like at the end of the plan. It feels like we are diving into these without a rubric sometimes.</td>

<td>Newsletters add to the load and do not feel authentic and the way I would want my content and learning to be expressed or summed up.</td>

<td>Stage 3 - Discomfort</td>
<td>Feel there is a disconnect between faculty and administration</td>

<td>XP classes still need to be addressed. Students do not take them seriously and behaviors are many times not acceptable during the period. One day a week for a longer block would work out better. This is not a good use of instructional time.</td>
<td>Stage 2 - Doubt</td>
<td>Parents are not treating the faculty like they are professionals. Some treat the faculty as if they are beneath them. Parents only contact teachers or respond to teachers when there is something that they feel negatively impacted their child, even though they may not have the entire story. Parents are talking about children and teachers at social events, as well as at board meetings, in a degrading and disrespectful way. There is a feeling of entitlement and that sentiment carries into the school building. Maybe parents need parenting classes.</td>

<td>Stage 5 - Understanding</td>
<td>I feel that I am confident and productive in my instructional practices with my students, with a solid understanding of my content and instructional strategies. Additionally, I have worked a lot on fostering a growth mindset among my students and myself in recent years.</td>
<td>I would appreciate time to explore instructional practices and methods specific to my field/area of specialty.</td>
<td>Stage 5 - Understanding</td>
<td>I do try to keep students' interests and strengths incorporated into my activity choices and instructional practices, while continuing to expose them to new ideas and concepts as well as support areas that need improvement.</td>
<td>Time to be creative in my lesson/activity development as well as to explore other resources (whether online or in person) would be helpful.</td>
<td>Stage 6 - Integration</td>
<td>Parent engagement is something that is a big part of my role, and I work hard to foster good relationships and collaborate with them as we establish goals and next steps together for their child. Providing personal anecdotes and work samples, rather than simply test data, is something that I think parents highly value.</td>
<td>Continued time to foster relationships and trust with parents will allow for continued engagement.</td>
<td>Stage 3 - Discomfort</td>
<td>I can think of elements of ALL of the stages 1-5 on the change cycle wheel - at times there is fear (stage 1) - "will this be used against me", "will I get written up", often there is skepticism (stage 2) - "the new Steering Committee won't work", "there's a hidden agenda", and yet there are glimmers of feeling energized (stage 4) and having anticipation for things to get better (stage 4), or even working together in a productive and confident way (stage 5). However, I chose stage 3 because I feel the overriding feelings seem to be anxiety or the unproductive worry that nothing is getting better.</td>
<td>There's a feeling of being micromanaged - all of our time, our initiatives, etc. We may be given a choice of books to read or a choice of strategies to try for personalized PD, but the reality is it's a forced choice. I think that teachers would value having time to explore their own areas of professional interest through book reading or PD time. I also think that might help teachers feel like they have a voice as well as that they are being trusted to be the professionals they are. Considering ways to support one another through fun activities, self-care or mindfulness practices may also be a way to foster a more supportive climate. Continued work of the Steering Committee and Research and Development teams will hopefully also help faculty and admin feel like climate and trust is improving.</td>

<td>Stage 3 - Discomfort</td>
<td>Feeling anxious having time to align curriculum, bridge gaps with academic and behavioral expectations, while supporting children to not give up when facing challenges. There is a supportive classrooms atmosphere, while most kids are responsive to teachers. I think there needs to be a way to ensure higher levels of expectations both academically and behaviorally. This would increase student metacognition, kids would have better social emotional regulation strategies and self monitoring skills.</td>
<td>School wide social emotional curriculum, responsive classroom model, and consistency with stability among educators,admin, and students. Ways to help students, teachers, parents, and staff follow the code of conduct.</td>
<td>Stage 3 - Discomfort</td>
<td>Xp offers opportunities both academic and non academic enrichment activities for students. Teachers are starting to think of enrichment activities but still have that feeling that they need to give the same pre/post assessment (ex.math) to every child so they can report those grades at data meetings. Are we exceling the higher level student and are we making the student with significant learning needs feel the impossible? How can we meet enrichment for all students?</td>
<td>Consider the rigor and relevance in those skills, collect data to see if it is educating students for the future. Also to educate teachers who do not teach XP or Ed Tech on those skills needed for a digital world. XP and SPecial Area teachers have such background on working with students to enrich them. How can we give staff more training on the technology of the 21st century, using a 3d printer, utilizing skills to enrich. Teachers need more opportunities to enrich their curriculum and differentiate. Then they could use it more in the classrooms. Increasing student sense of belonging to positive peer groups would increase their education commitment.</td>
<td>Stage 5 - Understanding</td>
<td>More communication being sent to parents about progress monitoring, data results, school website, new design of open house on one day (even though not great turn out but design model just needs to be made more public and sent out in a few reminders).</td>
<td>Stage 2 - Doubt</td>
<td>Feelings of doubt on school culture and climate continue. There is not always a trusting and caring relationship among and between all admin. However, that being said, Tracy has gone above and beyond to improve a caring and trusting relationship with students and teachers. At other times the school and climate would not be what I consider collaborative and collegial. Many teachers on different committees have shared ideas, solutions, suggestions. Later to learn that communication, discussions, focus group discussions were pushed to the side, changed, and not moved forward as discussed. This seems to be the end result of poor relationships/interactions between staff and admin. Have subcommittees to voice opinions for example on encouraging more individualized Professional Development and then to be told you have to pick a strategy to target your own PD is not looking into individualization. Sometimes letting go of the rigid structure and really asking teachers first without guidelines...what would be an area of PD you would want to work on, learn about, take a webinar, specifically look at a math program, and dive deeper in, without specific parameters. To ensure teacher decision making (without making teachers feel like it is just another thing to do) teachers need to feel heard and trusted. We want professional learning to support and to promote teacher and student learning.</td>
<td>Continue to build trust among teachers and administration by letting teachers at times be part of the decision making process, have ownership in decisions, and feel part of the group at whole. Continuing to say thank you to admin when they send for example a nice email after a meeting or stop in to discuss how a situation was handled. I will continue to work on open communication with admin, try to ask for clarification if needed, and have positive growth mindset. Continuing looking at the Sherman Core Values as a faculty across school settings. Hopefully the Steering Committee continues to focus on topics of change and trust and has Patrick Flynn back at least 2-3 times this year to support these changes. Having admin get feedback on professional learning support this is needed and not driven by a list of strategies would help develop more collegiality.</td>

<td>Stage 3 - Discomfort</td>
<td>Too many new initiatives- it is impossible to do everything that is asked of classroom teachers. Has administration considered how many new things they have asked classroom teachers in particular to do in just the short beginning of this school year? What have you relieved the teachers of so that they may accomplish these new tasks? Have you considered what the main responsibility of a classroom teacher truly is- planning and preparing for the students? There seems to be no time given for this and it is not made a priority. You have created a situation that makes it impossible for us to be successful by not being mindful of how much you are asking of people who already have very, very full plates. It is heartbreaking.</td>
<td>Stop inundating the classroom teachers with more and more work: newsletters, posting of newsletter (this is a non-teaching duty), never ending data collection and multiple ways of recording that are impossible to keep up with for just one subject, new curriculum that is not given time to plan for, additional SRBI responsibilities and forms, goals with multiple action steps, "personalized PD" that is not truly personalized and is like the requirements of a college course. IT IS TOO MUCH! Actually allow teachers to use PD time to do what they need to do. We are all professionals here and if you truly respect us as "colleagues" you would respect us enough to give us this true "voice and choice". Not everything needs to be reported and micromanaged. Isn't it enough that we have to write sub plans to go to a workshop, now we have to report on it? Or report how we spend PD time? This shows a major lack of trust and respect.</td>
<td>Stage 2 - Doubt</td>
<td>It is hard to plan for such things when our enrollment is dropping so drastically. We need to be more realistic.</td>
<td>Stop asking teachers and staff for yet more and more of their time. Be realistic about our community. If there is a bigger picture and a grand plan here, please share.</td>
<td>Stage 3 - Discomfort</td>
<td>Again, asking the teachers to do more, more more. What has been taken away so that this can be accomplished?</td>
<td>Stop adding more for teachers and staff to do without taking something away.</td>
<td>Stage 3 - Discomfort</td>
<td>This has nothing to do with the students or other teachers/staff and everything to do with the teachers' and administration's relationship. There is no support. Everyone is afraid of getting in trouble. There is no sincerity to anything that is said. Veteran teachers are no longer confident because we are always second guessing ourselves due to lack of support and fear. It is a toxic work environment. Administrators do not listen to the teachers or truly support them in what they need. We are clearly not your "colleagues". Your actions show we are your subordinates. We are not respected as the highly educated, experienced professionals that we all are.</td>
<td>I cannot see a way to move forward. So much damage has been done. It truly seems hopeless, and it is heartbreaking. Look at the sheer number of people who have left the school in the past 3 years. It is plain to see there is a problem.</td>

<td>Stage 3 - Discomfort</td>
<td>I am confused about the work the was put into our new social studies curriculum. Many hours were spent this summer to write curriculum, a new program was chosen as a resource, but it hasn't been mentioned once in our PD/faculty meeting times. Staff who didn't do summer work needed to reach out to those that did to figure out what is the plan and how to implement. If this important, time should have been given to review what was done over the summer and to go through this new curriculum and program. <br />So much of our time is not being spent on instructional planning. We have work to accomplish to be prepared for the strategic goal groups, for R&amp;D groups, for personalized PD, our SLO's and 3 other goals, that daily planning is rushed. We have to make sure that we are prepared for these meetings which takes up much of my prep time and often much of it has to be done on my own personal time.</td>
<td>To move forward we need to take a look at what is being expected of teachers and the time they are given. I would like to learn new things during PD that I can implement in my classroom. Instead, faculty and PD time is spent divided between strategic plan meetings, R&amp;D meetings, and not spent on instructional planning or looking at student data. Date team meetings have been limited to 3 or 4 times this year for about an hour each!</td>
<td>Stage 3 - Discomfort</td>
<td>Although providing students with alternative courses to take is interesting, I am not sure that our current system is working. Scores are going down, teachers need to develop their own courses and what is then students take away (is it tapping into their interests?)Teachers need to spend time again not planning for instructional content in reading, writing, math, etc, but now on this extra course.</td>
<td>Focus needs to be brought back to the student and what we need to teach them to help them become the best versions of themselves.</td>
<td>Stage 3 - Discomfort</td>
<td>I always thought that teachers had a great relationship with parents and the community. This year, I was amazed at how many parents didn't show up to Open House and wonder what has changed. I believe many ideas were brought up about how to increase parent involvement but really haven't seen these in action (again seems like teachers have to do in their time somehow).</td>
<td>not sure</td>
<td>Stage 1 - Loss</td>
<td>I feel that the moral is the worse it has been. Although the teachers are a great support to each other, overall it is very hard to remain positive. I became a teacher because I love children and teaching them is fun and rewarding. Each day I focus on my room of students which is still rewarding, but before school, preps, meetings, my after school time, I feel so stressed with what I need to get done, not just for my students but for all of the other expectations. <br />I also don't feel that admin has made an effort to build a relationship with staff but more importantly with the students. It is a rarity to see admin throughout the building interacting with students. Some of our youngest learners don't know the difference between the principal and assistant principal let alone who these individuals are. <br />I am in a paralyzed state because I don't feel that staff and admin are working together. I don't know what they think about me, and am always fearful going into a meeting, did I get everything done, is it going to be enough, what am I going to be questioned about. Being motivated and encouraged to start the year was not how I started the year. Even our first few days together, it was straight back to business, not welcoming or motivating.</td>
<td>A GREAT effort to build true caring relationships with staff and students. <br />Building an environment that fosters trust and respect (I don't feel that we are respected as adults and qualified professionals).</td>

<td>Stage 2 - Doubt</td>
<td>We do these things already, and have been doing them well all along. This is not a change 'issue' because nothing has changed. That being said, scores are low and we were told in 2016 that if the 'new schedule' translated to poor test scores that Jeff would own up to it. This has not been the case, instead we have a new math interventionist (something we never needed in the past), teachers are now being told to give preunit tests, pregrade tests, sbac iab tests, and STAR tests, on top of requiring meeting after meeting to discuss data, scores, and instruction. More time is spent testing and assessing students than actually learning and teaching. Admin went from being all for the PBL style and teaching the 'whole student' to being overly concerned with keeping a paper trail of assessments (so that they don't get sued again I assume). This is why I have doubt that the "vision" around this element will actually work. We are told to think one way, but we are lead and directed another, more so this year than ever before.</td>
<td>1) We need to make a statement about the testing overload (sbac, star, benchmarks, pre assessments, finals, summative, formative.....). 5 years ago our school took this innovative approach and didn't pay any attention to these tests. There was no pressure to "perform" and the students did well because of it. Teachers were more relaxed, there was no stress, and students were allowed to be more creative in the classroom.<br />2) Stop forcing meaningless initiatives on teachers. For example, every PD day is micromanaged to promote some sort of "plan", "focus", or committee. Teachers aren't able to pursue things that interest them, or things that will actually improve them professionally. Im not saying our PD was great 5 years ago, but at least we got something out of it.</td>
<td>Stage 1 - Loss</td>
<td>XP is the entire reason why we have a schedule that doesn't allow us to meet the needs of our kids. The XP period is a loss of time that we all could use in our rooms with our kids. There was a little hype to start, but now the XP idea has faded and it has run its course.</td>
<td>Some XP's are good, but they should be clubs or electives. Get rid of that wasted 40 minute period every day, and give it back to the teachers.</td>
<td>Stage 1 - Loss</td>
<td>Jeff wants a newsletter (very 1990's), coffee meetings, and to force parents into the school for his expos (he doesn't realize that most parents in the 21st century work and want to spend their free time with family). This element of "parent engagement" is all about advertising our school to the community, like putting on a "show". Jeff has a reputation among the community if any parents disagree with the show Jeff asks them to come in for a closed door meeting, or urges parents to have 'coffee' with him. Under Jeff's advice, the BOE meanwhile has decided over the last few years that they are "hands off" and they refuse to listen to the concerns of the parents, community, and staff (no one goes to the boe meetings because if the public wants to comment they get bashed or silenced). Yet certain BOE members have no problem trashing teachers at public events (parents tell us about it all of the time....). The relationship between the school, boe, admin, and community is very toxic at the moment, and yet the element is focused on self promotion.</td>
<td>For teachers to be treated as professionals, and for the community to have a say in their school. We have more collective years of experience in running a school (especially Sherman School) and interacting with this specific community than all of the administrators times 10. We are very much a "community based" school, so as long as Jeff encourages his hard stance against community interaction (all while saying that he is promoting interaction at the same time) the school will struggle.</td>
<td>Stage 1 - Loss</td>
<td>Sorry about the the long list, but ever since the anonymous document came out I've been saving concerns. These were concerns that have built up over the last year alone, most since we started our work with Patrick:<br /><br />1) Jeff uses the "Faculty Handbook" as a way of circumventing the teaching contract. He thinks that he can just edit the handbook rather than consult with the Union about changes. Easy example from this year, we now have an added expectation of editing a newsletter (a non teaching duty) but rather than add this to our contract during negotiations, he changes our handbook because he won't have to "negotiate" that. He even brings up the handbook in meetings with staff as a way of saying it isn't a "union matter". This is a sneaky loophole, and does not lead to us trusting his leadership. On a similar note, Jeff also told our Faculty Council that he talked to the Union about the late day / open house being scheduled on the same day in September. The union reps denied that they were consulted with, and I believe them.<br /><br />2) There is an ongoing lawsuit in the Danbury Court against Jeff regarding confidentiality and 'non-compliance' with a contract (look it up on the CT judicial court website). If I remember the dates correctly, the audio for the boe meeting in question was mysteriously 'lost' (the staff/union had its own questions regarding the meeting). Convenient no? Either way, its not a good way to build up trust with the community or staff.<br /><br />3) In the last year, we read dozens of major concerns raised by staff in the faculty council's anonymous document, and watched as they got downplayed by Jeff to the BOE. Jeff even slipped up and told staff that he gave our "complaints" to the BOE, as if we were just whiny teachers (they were legitimate and serious concerns, not our complaints). He has yet to adjust his attitude towards staff, he still withholds information from the staff as a whole, and speaks to us condescendingly.<br /><br />4) Nontransparent process with the ransomware attack (if there was never a threat to our personal info why are we all getting the same robocalls, and why were we urged to change all passwords???). There is no reason to hide this information from the affected staff, which is all of us, unless he was trying to hide something in the 'ransomed' data.<br /><br />5) Jeff (and to an extent Tracy) targets staff that he feels "aren't a good fit" either due to age, salary, or the fact they have opinions different from him. I am curious to see what our recent departures (for example, Treva K, Donna L, Alyson H, Val M, Laura C, Sandra P, Kaitlyn W, Alexa B etc..) feel about the 'culture'. In all honesty, if they left for higher pay, shorter hours, or retirement, then good for them!!!! But if they left because they felt pushed out or burned out by the atmosphere that is worth noting when we talk about culture and climate. Is it too much to ask our RD committee to seek these former personnel out for an interview as part of their research into the culture and climate? I am sure they would be more than willing to help us, unless they want nothing to do with our school anymore (that would be unfortunate but understandable) or were forced to sign something like a nondisclosure letter (this is something they do in the business world, and it would present a trust issue on a whole new unethical level).<br /><br />6) Similar to #5, we watched as Jeff harassed and ultimately pushed out our former assistant principal, teacher of the year, and union president. Roland H slipped up a few years back and said that he was looking for a 'complete turnover' in administration to breath new life into the school (I guess he forgot that Andy still worked here?). Andy was not "Jeff's hire" therefore we have known for years that he was going to get ousted. Just like #5, I am curious to hear what Andy would have to say about his reasons for leaving. Did he leave for higher career aspirations? Or did the culture/climate force him out? When you consider that Andy took a significant pay cut and a potentially 'career devastating' position regression (he went from Assistant Principal to 5th Grade teacher?), I have a feeling there was more to his ultimate decision to leave than simply looking for a change in scenery. As such a high status figure of Sherman's past, and a former administrator under Jeff's 'control', I think Andy would have valuable insight into how to fix the issues we have today.</td>
<td>The faculty handbook does not get edited unless the union agrees to the changes. I believe this is already a courtesy that was supposed to be given to us, but Jeff ignores it.<br /><br />We want an original, unadapted, write up from the forensic investigators in the ransomware attack, and we want a letter from the investigators stating that they weren't requested or demanded to change anything.<br /><br />Contact the employees who no longer work here, including Andy, regarding their reasons for leaving. We want to fix the school and their voices are equally as important to this process. They aren't "out of sight out of mind" to us, even if they are to Jeff.<br /><br />A new leadership style that appreciates the people that work here. I don't know how to fix the issues Jeff has brought on because there is no trust on so many different levels.</td>

There is A LOT of information being sent to us at various times of days, late nights and weekends, that makes it hard to keep up with the work/family life balance.</td>

<td>I chose this spot because I want to feel like I am moving forward, to be part of the solution, instead of the problem. But it is very hard. I don't feel like teachers are heard or supported in their quest to teach. We are constantly micromanaged in all things we do. <br />In addition, there is no time to plan because there are so many meetings, and so many different initiatives. And with each of these there is so much paperwork required. <br />The school feels more like a business than a school. <br />Our focus should be the students and it's hard to make them a focus because I feel like I am running in a million different directions to meet the expectations set forth by the administration. This causes a lot of resentment because I constantly feel like I am failing. Which is a horrible way to come to work each day when you used to love your job.</td>

<td>This is an area I'm conflicted about. I feel there are many creative ways we could enrich our students' experiences, but it seems to me that integrating these experiences into our curriculum would make them much more meaningful than they are now through XP, which is disconnected from the rest of their day. The XP period also reduces flexibility in our schedule. In addition, we don't have meaningful amounts of time to work with colleagues to plan cross-curricular projects.</td>

<td>Trust is still my main concern. Actions speak louder than words, and scheduling almost every minute of our PD time sends the message that teachers aren't trusted to make responsible, professional decisions about the work they need to do to support their students. In addition, doctors notes have never been required in the past, and asking for them now underscores the feeling that teachers aren't trusted.</td>
<td>Increased actions that allow teachers to feel trusted, and/or a decrease in actions/decisions that make teachers feel that they aren't trusted.</td>

<td>At this time I feel that parents are comfortable reaching out. I do however feel that in today's society, people are not paying attention to the calendars, notices, and emails that are being sent to them. They need constant reminders in order to get involved.</td>
<td>Stage 4 - Discovery</td>
